"""
Build systems are an extremely important detail of any software project. When they work,
they can feel like magic: you execute a command, and after a series of potentially
complicated steps, a working binary (or other artifact) is produced! When they don't work,
they can feel like confusing, non-transparent roadblocks that you wish didn't exist. This
is typical for any powerful tool: magic or a headache depending on the day and the task.

# what are all the data points that are being generated?
# Build:
#   - 

# worspace, users and other such are "by" variables which are used to group the data
# in general all the business related things fall in this category
# while all the things from engineering side are the actual data:
#         business: by user, workspace, project
#      engineering: build, deploy (serve), jobs
#            build: disk_space, cpu, memory, network, gpu
#   deploy (serve): model, model_properties, networking, compute (flops), memory (storage)
#             jobs: operators
