"""
This is CLI for ``nbox``, it is meant to be as simple to use as possible. We using ``python-fire`` for building
our CLI, which means you can access underlying system with same commands as you use with python. For maximum
convinience we recommend adding an alias for ``nbx`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  [zshrc]
  echo "\\nalias nbx='python3 -m nbox'\\n" >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc

  [bashrc]
  echo "\\nalias nbx='python3 -m nbox'\\n" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc


SSH into Instances
------------------

You can SSH into your instance with the ``nbx tunnel`` command. This command will create a tunnel
to your instance and start an SSH session.

.. code-block:: bash

  nbx tunnel 8000 -i "instance-name"
